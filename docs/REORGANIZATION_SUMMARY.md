# Directory Reorganization Summary

## What Was Changed

### Documentation (`/docs`)
- Moved `bet_tracker_prd.md` → `/docs/`
- Moved `BetTracker-Code-Summary.md` → `/docs/`
- Moved `macos/BetTracker/PRD-Implementation.md` → `/docs/macos/`
- Created subdirectories for future docs: `/docs/api/`, `/docs/backend/`

### Tests (`/tests`)
- Moved `/test/` → `/tests/fixtures/` (bet screenshots)
- Moved `test-bets.js`, `setup-users.js`, `admin-link.js` → `/tests/integration/`
- Created subdirectories for future tests: `/tests/macos/`, `/tests/backend/`

### Data Files (`/data`)
- Created `/data/exports/`
- Moved all `export-*.csv` files → `/data/exports/`

### macOS App Organization (`/macos/BetTracker/BetTracker/`)
- Created logical subdirectories:
  - `/Views/` - All SwiftUI views
  - `/Services/` - Business logic and external services
  - `/Utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
  - `/Models/` - Data models (empty, for future use)

- File movements:
  - `AuthenticationView.swift`, `BetApprovalView.swift`, `BetDetailsInputView.swift`, `SettingsView.swift` → `/Views/`
  - `AuthenticationManager.swift`, `SupabaseClient.swift` → `/Services/`
  - `ParticipantParser.swift` → `/Utils/`
  - `BetTrackerApp.swift` remains in root (app entry point)

### New Documentation Created
- `/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` - Comprehensive guide to project organization
- `/macos/README.md` - macOS app specific documentation

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Documentation, tests, and code are clearly separated
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new platforms (iOS, Android) or features
3. **Discoverability**: New developers can quickly understand the project
4. **Maintainability**: Related files are grouped together
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Tests are organized for automated testing

## No Code Changes Required

The reorganization only moved files - no import statements or code needed updating because:
- Swift/Xcode handles imports at the module level
- TypeScript edge functions use relative imports that weren't affected
- Test scripts were already self-contained

## Next Steps

When adding new files:
- Place documentation in `/docs/[component]/`
- Place tests in `/tests/[component]/`
- Place Swift views in `/macos/BetTracker/BetTracker/Views/`
- Place Swift services in `/macos/BetTracker/BetTracker/Services/`
- Place utilities in `/macos/BetTracker/BetTracker/Utils/`
